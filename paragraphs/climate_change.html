    Climate change is when the usual weather on Earth changes over a long time. Imagine, if your favorite ice cream starts melting too quickly in the summer, that’s because the Earth is getting warmer. This is happening because of things like cars and factories that release gases, which make a sort of blanket around the Earth. This blanket traps the Sun’s heat and causes the Earth to get hotter, this is called global warming. It’s like wearing too many sweaters on a sunny day! This can cause big problems like the polar ice caps melting, which are the Earth’s big ice cubes, causing sea levels to rise. It can also lead to extreme weather like storms and droughts. Animals can lose their homes if their environment changes too much. So, it’s important for us to take care of our planet by doing things like recycling and using less energy by turning off lights when we leave a room. Remember, every little bit helps to stop climate change and keep the Earth happy and healthy!
