Political disturbance like hartal also causes price hike for the time being. price hike has dreadful effect in our life and national economy. It causes untold sufferings to the poor and the middle class people. Many people cannot buy daily necessaries. Some of them remain half fed. As a result they suffer from malnutrition.
